# Etch A Sketch

A simple project exploring CSS Grid layout and a clean layout for Etch A Sketch.

Updating the sketchpad is relatively slow, given that it recreates a lot of new elements. A more optimal solution would be to only create/delete the necessary elements, instead of everything.

Alternatively using a canvas element will likely allow much more performance and flexability.
